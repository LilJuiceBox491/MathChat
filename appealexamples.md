## Banned for exposing personal information of other Scratchers.

### GOOD APPEAL:
Hello. I was banned from ScratchChat roughly an hour ago for 'exposing personal information of other Scratchers'. 

<otherUser> and I were talking in ScratchChat, while other people were also in the room. The other user and I have been friends for a long time, and wanted to reveal our real names to each other.

We went to a containment room, and did it, then moved back to Default.

About an hour later, the other user and I got into a heated argument about which was better, NFL or NBA.

The other user threatened to leak my IP address if I didn't agree that the NFL was better, so I got upset and told him to stop, or I would leak his personal info.

I was feeling really threatened, and I know I could have just left the room, but I didn't.

I told the other user that he should stop, or he will regret it. He thought I was just joking around and continued to say that I 'better admit that NFL > NBA, or I will leak your IP'.

At this time, I felt really upset, and I made a mistake. I told everyone his real name. 

I really regret this now, and 100% own up to my mistake. I apologized to the other user as well as everyone who had to see this.

Thank you,  

User.
